## Please ```git pull```  !!!

*Many* deletions have been done of folder-bloat.

Most importantly, database files are deleted. These don't need to be git-tracked.

Worse, changes to our code changes the databases, and these changes are individual to each contributer.

SO, having to resolve merge-conflicts with database files (which you cannot obviously modify) are not possible.

So, they'd have to be deleted anyway.
